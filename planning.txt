Planning for Tic Tac Toe game

We are going to write psuedocode here.
1. Draw the lines 
console log the board 
    use an array to represent the board 
    our array would have nine null values to start
2. X's goes first
Use a "Turn Variable to store whose turn it is 
Player 1 is X Player 2 is O
3. X chooses a spot
    replace null value with turn variable
Change the turn 
    Update turn variable to be opposite of what it currently is

4. O chooses a spot
    Make sure spot is available
    If spot has a Null  value it is available
    Then replace null value with turn variable
5. Repeat until the game ends 
    loop
6. Check if someone has 3 in a row then they are the winner 
    This should take place at the end of each turn 
7. it is a tie  If there are no more spaces then 
    This should take place at the end of each turn 
    no more null values or no conditions were true 
8. Repeat all steps to play again 


MVC Paradigm/ Separation of Concerns
The model represents our data that is meant to represent the state of our game or application
The view - The portion of our code that displays something to the user. 
The controller - represents the logic of the application. The controller uses the data from the Model and gives it to the view.
